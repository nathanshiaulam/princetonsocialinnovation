  <br>

  <p style="text-align:center;">In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxPrincetonU, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxPrinceton event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>

   <h4>ANDREW HEWITT</h4><hr/>
 </div>
 <div class="large-6 small-6 columns">
   <p>Andrew’s passion was ignited when he witnessed his talented university friends strive for success in high status careers, only to find themselves disheartened by the profit-at-all-cost corporate mentality. He wondered why society defines success in business through lists like the Fortune 500 that rank organizations based on revenue alone, and so redefining success became his mission, leading Andrew to publish a bestselling book, The Power of Focus for College Students. To help redefine success in business, Andrew created GameChangers 500 to showcase the world’s top purpose-driven organizations using business as a force for good. GameChangers 500 ranks organizations based on their social and environmental impact and their ability to maximize benefit not just profit. Andrew’s progress in helping define a new “For-Benefit” model of business earned him a seat on the Advisory Council for the Fourth Sector Mapping Initiative. Together, this group is helping to formalize the For-Benefit legal model to join the existing three sectors—for-profit, non-profit and government. When he’s not helping change the game of business, Andrew is helping redefine how we measure our success as individuals through Version2.me - a personal development program that helps people become empowered despite circumstance and lead with empathy rather than ego.</p>

   <h4>RADHA AGRAWAL</h4><hr/>
   </div>
  <div class="large-6 small-6 columns">
   <p>Radha launched Super Sprowtz in 2011 after she and her identical twin sister Miki launched their first of three farm-to-table gluten-free pizza restaurants, Wild, in New York City and she noticed children were not ordering vegetables on their pizzas. As an experiment, she created “super hero” characters for a children’s menu where the characters had super powers that were directly related to their nutritional benefit (ie. Colby Carrot had “super sight” because carrots are good for the eyes, etc.) and she watched child after child run to the counter to order vegetables for their pizzas to gain the super powers of the “Super Sprowtz.” Super Sprowtz was thus born through the power of storytelling and the behavioral change it inspired in children. In 2013, Radha, along with her twin sister Miki and best friend Antonia, launched THINX on Kickstarter. She and her partners were recipients of the 2013 Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Awards for THINX and their work in menstruation management for their invention of a “leak and stain resistant” technology to help women manage their monthly cycle in both developed and developing countries. They were one of 30 brands chosen to be featured on TOMS Marketplace in 2014 and have won several competitions, including the CrowdFundX Challenge in New York City and the Grommet Challenge in Boston. Radha has been called “one of eight women who will change the world” by MTV in 2014, and one of 20 “Millenials on a Mission” by Forbes in 2013. She was a recipient of the 2013 Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Awards.</p>
